TODOs:
- make sensitive links password-protected (i.e. some internal slides for reading group)
- separate the news / seminar / blog posts in the _posts folder into subfolders or into three different "blogs"
- adjust colors for news/seminar page (gray, font from publications page?) 

DONE:
- implement blog
- implement seminar as a collection (similar to news)
